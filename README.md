TomahawkPHP Standard Edition
-------------------------

Welcome to the TomahawkPHP Standard Edition - a fully-functional TomahawkPHP application built on top of Symfony2 Components that you can use as the skeleton for your new applications.

This document contains information on how to download, install, and start
using TomahawkPHP.

1) Installing the Standard Edition
----------------------------------

As TomahawkPHP uses [Composer][2] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to create a new project is to use it.

Get one of the releases from [here][1].

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Download composer (see above) and run the
following command:

    php composer.phar install
